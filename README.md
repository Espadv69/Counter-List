# React Counter List Project

## Objective
Build a React application where users can manage a dynamic list of counters. Each counter operates independently and can perform basic operations like incrementing and resetting its value.

## Features
1. **Add Counter**: Users should be able to add new counters dynamically.
2. **Increment Counter**: Each counter should have a button to increase its value by one.
3. **Reset Counter**: Each counter should have a button to reset its value to zero.
4. **Dynamic Behavior**: The list of counters should update in real-time as counters are added or interacted with.

## Requirements
- Use React functional components and hooks to manage state.
- Ensure the UI is responsive and user-friendly.
- No limits on the number of counters a user can add.

## Bonus (Optional)
- Add a "Delete Counter" feature to remove individual counters from the list.
- Style the application using CSS to make it visually appealing.
